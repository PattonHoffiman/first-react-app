# First App Template

Using **create-react-app**, but removing some files witch maybe you does not need for begin your projet. Also added the devDependencies in `package.json` because **create-react-app** lacks this.

### Prerequisites
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Use
 - Create a Project using this as [Template](https://github.com/PattonHoffiman/first-react-app/generate)
 - Clone then:
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-github/your-project.git
    ```
- Now just install using **yarn**

    ```
    yarn install
    ```
- Wait for the installation and then you can begin to `code`!
